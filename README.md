# Covus - COVID-19 Recovered Meter
Extremely *simple*, *clean*, COVID-19 meter, which **only** shows recovered percentage. 
Made in Bootstrap and Vanilla JS for clean look.
Try a quick [demo](https://covus.vercel.app/).

Stay happy and wear mask! ðŸ˜·


> Fun Fact: The name was actually a typo. I was about to write Covid but wrote Covus, still, interesting name.
